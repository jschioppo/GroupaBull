# GroupaBull

GroupaBull is a website allowing USF students an easy avenue to meet with classmates for studying or class work. Students can find or create a course group. Different courses are organized by major with the user would specify during course creation. Within these groups students have the ability to create meetups that any student in that course group can join. 

## Technology

GroupaBull is being devloped with the ASP.NET MVC framework. Languages used include C#, Razor, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Additional tools used include jQUery, Ajax, and ASP.NET identity. The database is made with MSSQL. The site and database are both hosted on Microsoft Azure.

## Prerequisites

All testing was done on a modern version of Chrome. The site should function normally in other proper browsers, but Chrome is recommended as that is where all testing is done, at least for now.

## Update Notes

The site is currently in progress, contributions are made intermittently and completion time is unknown. I am the only developer on the project. Updates are always published to a Dev-Test Azure server. While most operations require registration with a USF only email address (for student privacy), almost all features can be seen as they currently stand without an account. This will most likely change when the site goes live to protect student information. 

Most completed work has to do with the backend of the site, mostly in the database management. All registration info is handled with a slightly customized ASP.NET Identity setup, which is a pre-configured tool by Microsoft to handle several registration and account management processes in MVC projects.
